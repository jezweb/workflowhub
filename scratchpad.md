# WorkflowHub 2.0 Development Progress

## Critical Security Fix - Email Verification Bypass - COMPLETED ✅ (2025-09-02)

### Problem
Users could bypass email verification and get immediate dashboard access after registration due to:
1. Fallback logic in Login.tsx calling store's register() in catch block
2. AuthStore's register function expected token and auto-logged in users
3. This completely bypassed the email verification requirement

### Solution Implemented
✅ Removed token handling from authStore register function
✅ Removed fallback to store register in Login.tsx catch block
✅ Registration now only shows success message, no auto-login
✅ Proper error handling for registration failures
✅ Users must verify email before accessing dashboard

## Email Verification System - COMPLETED ✅ (2025-09-02)

### Problem Statement
Previous system allowed immediate access after registration with unverified emails from allowed domains. This was a security risk as anyone could register with fake emails.

### Solution Architecture
Implementing token-based email verification using n8n webhook for email delivery.

### Implementation Plan
1. **Database Schema Changes**
   - Add `email_verified` BOOLEAN field (default FALSE)
   - Add `verification_token` TEXT field for unique tokens
   - Add `verification_expires` DATETIME for token expiry
   - Add `verification_sent_at` DATETIME for rate limiting

2. **Backend Changes**
   - Generate secure verification tokens on registration
   - Store tokens with 24-hour expiration
   - Create unverified users (cannot login until verified)
   - Send verification email via n8n webhook
   - New endpoints: verify-email, resend-verification

3. **Frontend Changes**
   - Post-registration verification prompt
   - Email verification page
   - Resend verification option
   - Block login for unverified users

4. **n8n Integration**
   - Webhook receives: email, verification_link, user_name
   - n8n sends formatted verification email
   - Configurable email templates

### Files Modified
- ✅ Created migration: `0004_email_verification.sql`
- ✅ Updated `src/worker/routes/auth.ts` with verification logic
- ✅ Created `src/worker/utils/verification.ts` for token handling
- ✅ Updated `src/pages/Login.tsx` with verification messages
- ✅ Created `src/pages/EmailVerification.tsx` for token validation
- ✅ Updated `src/App.tsx` with email verification route
- ✅ Updated `wrangler.toml` with EMAIL_WEBHOOK_URL and APP_URL
- ✅ Updated `src/worker/types.ts` with new environment variables

### Features Delivered
✅ Email verification tokens with 24-hour expiration
✅ Unverified users cannot login
✅ n8n webhook integration for sending emails
✅ Email verification page with token validation
✅ Resend verification with 5-minute rate limiting
✅ Success/error messages throughout the flow
✅ Secure token generation using crypto API

### Testing Notes
- n8n webhook URL: https://n8n.coolify.au/webhook/946b3a0d-5b5e-488a-a523-94999d3765f9
- Webhook needs to be configured for POST requests in n8n
- Email template can use: email, username, verificationLink, subject, appName, expiryHours
