### Technical Stack
- **Frontend**: React 19, TypeScript 5.8, shadcn/ui, Tailwind CSS, Zustand, React Hook Form + Zod
- **Backend**: Cloudflare Workers, Hono, D1 (SQLite), R2 Storage, JWT
- **Build**: Vite 6, Wrangler

### Key Design Decisions
1. **No KV Cache** - Direct D1 queries for simplicity
2. **JWT Auth** - Stateless authentication
3. **JSON Fields** - Store form fields and settings as JSON
4. **Nested Chats** - Parent-child conversation structure
5. **Configurable Actions** - HTTP method and payload templates
6. **n8n Owns Chat Memory** - WorkflowHub only tracks metadata
7. **Agent Configuration** - Pass config to n8n for dynamic behavior
8. **File Handling** - Base64 for <1MB, R2 URLs for larger files
9. **No Streaming Initially** - Simple request/response to start
10. **Dual Webhooks** - One for chat, optional second for history retrieval
