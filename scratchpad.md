- **Frontend UI**: Agent list, create, edit, test, and delete functionality
- **JWT Authentication**: Fixed middleware to use consistent secrets
- **TypeScript**: Complete type definitions and validation
- **Testing**: API endpoints tested and working

### Key Features Implemented
1. **Agent Management**: Create, read, update, delete agents
2. **Configuration System**: Headers, parameters, secrets for webhook calls
3. **Agent Templates**: Support for different AI models (GPT, Claude, Gemini)
4. **Public/Private Agents**: Share agents with team or keep private
5. **Webhook Testing**: Test agent configurations directly from UI
6. **Agent Metadata**: System prompts, temperature, max tokens configuration

### API Endpoints Working
- `GET /api/agents` - List user's agents and public agents
- `POST /api/agents` - Create new agent with configurations
- `GET /api/agents/:id` - Get agent details with configurations
- `PUT /api/agents/:id` - Update agent and configurations
- `DELETE /api/agents/:id` - Delete agent
- `POST /api/agents/:id/test` - Test agent webhook

### Frontend Components Created
- **Agents Page**: Main agent management interface
- **AgentEditor**: Create/edit agent modal with tabbed interface
- **AgentTester**: Test agent webhook with live results
- **Navigation**: Added Agents section to app navigation

### Database Status
- Migration 0002_agents_system.sql applied successfully
- Test agent created and verified in database
- All relationships and constraints working correctly

### Documentation Updated
- ARCHITECTURE.md includes complete agent system documentation
- Webhook protocol specification documented
- Design philosophy and benefits explained

## How to Use

### Forms
1. Open browser to http://localhost:5175
2. Register a new account or login with testuser/password123
3. Navigate to Forms section

## Next Steps ðŸ“‹

### Immediate: Agent & Chat System
1. **Phase 1: Agent Management**
   - Create agent database schema
   - Build agent CRUD API endpoints
   - Create agent management UI (list, create, edit, test)
   - Add default agent templates
   
2. **Phase 2: Chat Integration**
   - Update conversations table (minimal, n8n owns history)
   - Implement chat API endpoints (create, send, fetch history from n8n)
   - Build chat UI components
   - Connect to n8n webhooks
   
3. **Phase 3: File Support**
   - Add file attachment to chat messages
   - Base64 encoding for small files
   - URL generation for large files
   - Pass to n8n for processing

### Future Enhancements
- Add drag-and-drop field reordering for forms
- Add webhook integrations for form submissions
- Streaming chat responses (SSE from n8n)
- Agent marketplace/sharing
- Conversation collections/folders
- Future file enhancements (compress/convert for 4MB limit)
- Deploy to production

## Technical Stack
- **Frontend**: React 19, TypeScript 5.8, shadcn/ui, Tailwind CSS, Zustand, React Hook Form + Zod
- **Backend**: Cloudflare Workers, Hono, D1 (SQLite), R2 Storage, JWT
- **Build**: Vite 6, Wrangler

## Key Design Decisions
1. **No KV Cache** - Direct D1 queries for simplicity
2. **JWT Auth** - Stateless authentication
3. **JSON Fields** - Store form fields and settings as JSON
4. **Nested Chats** - Parent-child conversation structure
5. **Configurable Actions** - HTTP method and payload templates
6. **n8n Owns Chat Memory** - WorkflowHub only tracks metadata, n8n D1 Memory stores messages
7. **Agent Configuration** - Pass config to n8n for dynamic behavior from single workflow
8. **File Handling** - Base64 for <1MB, R2 URLs for larger files
9. **No Streaming Initially** - Simple request/response to start
10. **Dual Webhooks** - One for chat, optional second for history retrieval

## Database Schema Summary
- `users` - Basic auth with username/email/password
- `forms` - Form definitions with JSON fields
- `form_submissions` - Submitted form data
- `actions` - Webhook configurations
- `agents` - AI agent configurations with webhooks (NEW)
- `conversations` - Minimal tracking, n8n owns history (UPDATED)
- `messages` - Not used, n8n stores messages (DEPRECATED)
- `files` - File metadata (R2 storage)
- `settings` - Key-value user settings

## API Endpoints Created
```
/api/auth/register     - User registration
/api/auth/login        - User login
/api/auth/verify       - Token verification
/api/forms/*           - Forms CRUD + submissions
/api/files/*           - File operations
/api/database/*        - Database viewer
/api/chat/*            - Chat conversations
/api/actions/*         - Action buttons
/api/settings/*        - User settings
```

## Known Issues
- bcryptjs import may need adjustment for Workers environment
- File upload implementation pending
- AI chat integration not implemented

## Notes
- Using account ID: 0460574641fdbb98159c98ebf593e2bd
- JWT secret needs to be changed in production
- CORS currently allows all origins (update for production)
