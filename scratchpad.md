## Current Work ðŸš§
### Phase 7: File Management System (2025-09-02 09:50)

**Goal**: Implement simplified file management with R2 storage, multi-file upload, drag-and-drop, and table/grid views

**Implementation Plan**:
1. Create file type definitions
2. Implement backend R2 upload/download/delete
3. Build DropZone component with multi-file support
4. Create FileGrid and FileTable view components
5. Build main FileManager with view toggle
6. Add 4MB file size limit (configurable)
7. Test with various file types

**Key Features**:
- Multi-file upload with drag-and-drop
- Grid and table view modes
- 4MB file size limit for AutoRAG compatibility
- Image thumbnails and file type icons
- Download and delete operations
- Upload progress tracking

**Progress**:
- [x] Type definitions created
- [x] Backend R2 integration complete
- [x] DropZone component built with multi-file support
- [x] FileGrid view implemented with thumbnails
- [x] FileTable view implemented with sorting
- [x] FileManager integrated with view toggle
- [x] 4MB file size limit enforced
- [x] Testing completed

## How to Use

### Forms
1. Open browser to http://localhost:5175
2. Register a new account or login with testuser/password123
3. Navigate to Forms section
4. Click "New Form" to create a form with configurable field widths
5. Add fields, set widths (full, 1/2, 1/3, 1/4), configure properties
6. Preview form in the Preview tab
7. Save form and share the URL

### Actions
1. Navigate to Actions section
2. Click "New Action" to create a webhook action
3. Configure:
   - Basic Info: Name, description, HTTP method, URL
   - Request Config: Headers and JSON payload with variables
   - Response Handling: Choose modal, toast, or page response
4. Test the action with sample data
5. Execute actions directly or copy webhook URL for external use
6. Use variables like {{user.id}}, {{timestamp}} for dynamic data

### Files
1. Navigate to Files section
2. Click "Upload" or drag files to drop zone
3. Multiple files supported (4MB limit per file)
4. Toggle between Grid and Table views
5. Grid view shows image thumbnails
6. Table view allows sorting by name, size, date
7. Download or delete files with action buttons
8. File icons based on MIME type

## Next Steps ðŸ“‹
1. Add drag-and-drop field reordering
2. ~~Implement file upload to R2~~ âœ…
3. Add webhook integrations for form submissions
4. Implement nested chat structure with AI
5. ~~Create action button configuration~~ âœ…
6. Add database viewer with inline editing
7. Future file enhancements (compress/convert for 4MB limit)
8. Deploy to production

## Technical Stack
- **Frontend**: React 19, TypeScript 5.8, shadcn/ui, Tailwind CSS, Zustand, React Hook Form + Zod
- **Backend**: Cloudflare Workers, Hono, D1 (SQLite), R2 Storage, JWT
- **Build**: Vite 6, Wrangler

## Key Design Decisions
1. **No KV Cache** - Direct D1 queries for simplicity
2. **JWT Auth** - Stateless authentication
3. **JSON Fields** - Store form fields and settings as JSON
4. **Nested Chats** - Parent-child conversation structure
5. **Configurable Actions** - HTTP method and payload templates

## Database Schema Summary
- `users` - Basic auth with username/email/password
- `forms` - Form definitions with JSON fields
- `form_submissions` - Submitted form data
- `actions` - Webhook configurations
- `conversations` - Chat threads with nesting
- `messages` - Chat messages
- `files` - File metadata (R2 storage)
- `settings` - Key-value user settings

## API Endpoints Created
```
/api/auth/register     - User registration
/api/auth/login        - User login
/api/auth/verify       - Token verification
/api/forms/*           - Forms CRUD + submissions
/api/files/*           - File operations
/api/database/*        - Database viewer
/api/chat/*            - Chat conversations
/api/actions/*         - Action buttons
/api/settings/*        - User settings
```

## Known Issues
- bcryptjs import may need adjustment for Workers environment
- File upload implementation pending
- AI chat integration not implemented

## Notes
- Using account ID: 0460574641fdbb98159c98ebf593e2bd
- JWT secret needs to be changed in production
- CORS currently allows all origins (update for production)
