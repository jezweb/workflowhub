## Current Work ðŸš§
### Phase 6: Action Button Configuration System (2025-09-01 22:30)

**Goal**: Implement webhook action buttons with configurable HTTP methods, headers, and payload templates

**Implementation Plan**:
1. Create Action type definitions
2. Build ActionBuilder component with method selection
3. Create ActionEditor for headers/payload
4. Update Actions page with CRUD operations
5. Add execution with response handling
6. Test with real webhooks

**Progress**:
- [x] Type definitions created
- [x] ActionBuilder component built  
- [x] ActionEditor component created
- [x] Actions page updated with full CRUD
- [x] Execution handlers added
- [x] Response handling (modal, toast, page)
- [ ] Testing with real webhooks

## How to Use
1. Open browser to http://localhost:5175
2. Register a new account or login with testuser/password123
3. Navigate to Forms section
4. Click "New Form" to create a form with configurable field widths
5. Add fields, set widths (full, 1/2, 1/3, 1/4), configure properties
6. Preview form in the Preview tab
7. Save form and share the URL

## Next Steps ðŸ“‹
1. Add drag-and-drop field reordering
2. Implement file upload to R2
3. Add webhook integrations for form submissions
4. Implement nested chat structure with AI
5. Create action button configuration
6. Add database viewer with inline editing
7. Deploy to production

## Technical Stack
- **Frontend**: React 19, TypeScript 5.8, shadcn/ui, Tailwind CSS, Zustand, React Hook Form + Zod
- **Backend**: Cloudflare Workers, Hono, D1 (SQLite), R2 Storage, JWT
- **Build**: Vite 6, Wrangler

## Key Design Decisions
1. **No KV Cache** - Direct D1 queries for simplicity
2. **JWT Auth** - Stateless authentication
3. **JSON Fields** - Store form fields and settings as JSON
4. **Nested Chats** - Parent-child conversation structure
5. **Configurable Actions** - HTTP method and payload templates

## Database Schema Summary
- `users` - Basic auth with username/email/password
- `forms` - Form definitions with JSON fields
- `form_submissions` - Submitted form data
- `actions` - Webhook configurations
- `conversations` - Chat threads with nesting
- `messages` - Chat messages
- `files` - File metadata (R2 storage)
- `settings` - Key-value user settings

## API Endpoints Created
```
/api/auth/register     - User registration
/api/auth/login        - User login
/api/auth/verify       - Token verification
/api/forms/*           - Forms CRUD + submissions
/api/files/*           - File operations
/api/database/*        - Database viewer
/api/chat/*            - Chat conversations
/api/actions/*         - Action buttons
/api/settings/*        - User settings
```

## Known Issues
- bcryptjs import may need adjustment for Workers environment
- File upload implementation pending
- AI chat integration not implemented

## Notes
- Using account ID: 0460574641fdbb98159c98ebf593e2bd
- JWT secret needs to be changed in production
- CORS currently allows all origins (update for production)
